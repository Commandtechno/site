# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was ğŸ…±ootstrapped with [Create React App](https://githuğŸ…±.com/faceğŸ…±ook/create-react-app).

## AvailağŸ…±le Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your ğŸ…±rowser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section ağŸ…±out [running tests](https://faceğŸ…±ook.githuğŸ…±.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run ğŸ…±uild`

ğŸ…±uilds the app for production to the `ğŸ…±uild` folder.\
It correctly ğŸ…±undles React in production mode and optimizes the ğŸ…±uild for the ğŸ…±est performance.

The ğŸ…±uild is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to ğŸ…±e deployed!

See the section ağŸ…±out [deployment](https://faceğŸ…±ook.githuğŸ…±.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go ğŸ…±ack!**

If you aren't satisfied with the ğŸ…±uild tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single ğŸ…±uild dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (weğŸ…±pack, ğŸ…±ağŸ…±el, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, ğŸ…±ut they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitağŸ…±le for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel oğŸ…±ligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't ğŸ…±e useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
